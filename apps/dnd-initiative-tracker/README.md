# D&D Initiative Tracker

A React-based dashboard for managing Dungeons & Dragons combat. Track creatures, apply damage or healing on the fly, and keep the initiative order organized.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the development server URL that Vite prints (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to explore the tracker.

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server with hot module reloading.
- `npm run build` – build the production bundle.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` – lint the project using the configured ESLint rules.

## Project structure

- `src/App.jsx` – initiative tracker UI and combat logic.
- `src/App.css` – D&D-inspired dashboard styling.
- `src/index.css` – global resets and base colors.

Future tools—such as a quest log or treasure ledger—can live alongside this app inside the `apps/` directory.
